Playing around with vpython

Simulations:
- net electrostatic force on a point charge (assuming it's extremely heavy and doesn't move) as a result of surrounding point charges
- path of a charge in an electric field

Next Steps:
- Electric field lines?
- Fixing scaling/units in electric field
- Graphs
